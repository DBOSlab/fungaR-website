`fungaR` is an R package for accessing, analyzing, and curating fungal
taxonomic and distributional data from the [Flora e Funga do Brasil
(FFB)](https://floradobrasil.jbrj.gov.br/consulta/) platform, maintained
by the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden. It provides a comprehensive
interface to download, parse, filter, and explore Darwin Core Archive
(DwC-A) datasets from the [FFB
IPT](https://ipt.jbrj.gov.br/jbrj/resource?r=lista_especies_flora_brasil)
data portal — from browsing the checklist by taxonomic, geographic, and
trait-based criteria (including fungi-specific traits such as
nutritional mode, substrate/host, and lichenization status) to resolving
and matching your own species name lists against it.

Beyond data retrieval, `fungaR` assists taxonomic experts contributing
to FFB by cross-checking [MycoBank](https://www.mycobank.org) and
Brazilian occurrence repositories ([GBIF](https://www.gbif.org),
[speciesLink](https://specieslink.net), and the [Reflora Virtual
Herbarium](https://ipt.jbrj.gov.br/reflora/)) to flag fungal species and
state records that are plausibly Brazilian but still missing from the
platform.

## Workflow

## Installation

You can install the development version of `fungaR` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/DBOSlab/fungaR) with:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
install.packages("BiocManager")

# Install the development version of fungaR from GitHub,
# together with its required dependencies
BiocManager::install("DBOSlab/fungaR", dependencies = TRUE)
```

``` r
library(fungaR)
```

## Usage

`fungaR` supports a full workflow for working with Flora e Funga do
Brasil fungal data:

- Check available versions with `funga_version()`
- Download datasets with `funga_download()`
- Parse datasets with `funga_parse()`
- Filter and retrieve checklist records with `funga_records()`
- Resolve your own species names against the checklist with
  `funga_search()` and `funga_match()`
- Explore the taxonomic hierarchy with `funga_get_children_taxa()`
- Curate new records with `funga_mycobank_gap()` and
  `funga_distribution_gap()`

Most functions download and parse the FFB dataset automatically and
cache it locally, so you rarely need to call
`funga_download()`/`funga_parse()` yourself unless you want to inspect
the raw data directly. Note that FFB publishes plants and fungi together
in a single combined checklist — `funga_parse()` is what subsets
everything down to the Fungi kingdom for use by the rest of the package.

#### *1. `funga_version`: Check available dataset versions*

Get metadata about available Flora e Funga do Brasil dataset versions,
including version numbers, release dates, and whether they are the
latest version.

``` r
library(fungaR)

# Get all available versions
versions_df <- funga_version()
head(versions_df)

# View specific version details
versions_df[versions_df$Latest == TRUE, ]
```

#### *2. `funga_download`: Download Flora e Funga do Brasil datasets*

Download taxonomic and distributional records in Darwin Core Archive
(DwC-A) format. The function supports downloading the latest version,
specific versions, or all available versions.

``` r
library(fungaR)

# Download the latest dataset version (default)
funga_download(
 dir = "funga_download"
)

# Download a specific version
funga_download(
 version = "393.418", 
 dir = "funga_download"
)

# Download multiple versions
funga_download(
 version = c("393.418", "392.417"), 
 dir = "funga_download"
)

# Download all available versions (large download!)
funga_download(
 version = "all", 
 dir = "funga_download"
)
```

#### *3. `funga_parse`: Parse downloaded DwC-A datasets*

Parse and organize locally downloaded Flora e Funga do Brasil datasets
for analysis, keeping only the Fungi kingdom. This function works
offline once datasets are downloaded, and returns a named list with a
`taxon.txt`, `distribution.txt`, and `speciesprofile.txt` table (among
others) per downloaded version.

``` r
library(fungaR)

# Parse the latest downloaded version
dwca_data <- funga_parse(path = "funga_download",
                         version = "latest")

# View structure of the parsed data
names(dwca_data)
names(dwca_data[["dwca_ffb_v393_418"]][["data"]])

# Access specific data tables directly
taxon_data <- dwca_data[["dwca_ffb_v393_418"]][["data"]][["taxon.txt"]]
distribution_data <- dwca_data[["dwca_ffb_v393_418"]][["data"]][["distribution.txt"]]
```

#### *4. `funga_records`: Filter and retrieve checklist records*

Browse and filter the FFB checklist directly by taxonomic, geographic,
and trait-based criteria — no input name list required. Downloads and
parses the dataset automatically (like `funga_search()`, reusing the
local cache on repeated calls). For fungi, the `habitat` argument
doubles as substrate/host information (e.g. `"Planta viva - raiz"`,
`"Tronco em decomposicao"`, `"Outro fungo"`), since FFB does not publish
a separate named host-taxon field.

``` r
library(fungaR)

# All accepted species in Hymenochaetaceae
hymeno <- funga_records(taxon = "Hymenochaetaceae",
                        taxonomicStatus = "NOME_ACEITO")

# Accepted species endemic to Bahia
bahia_endemics <- funga_records(state = "Bahia",
                                endemism = TRUE,
                                taxonomicStatus = "NOME_ACEITO")

# Lichenized fungi recorded in the Caatinga
caatinga_lichens <- funga_records(phytogeographicDomain = "Caatinga",
                                  lifeForm = "Liquenizado")

# Fungi recorded growing on living plant roots (habitat = substrate/host)
root_associates <- funga_records(habitat = "Planta viva - raiz")

# Save the result to a CSV file
funga_records(
 taxon = "Trichoderma", 
 save = TRUE, 
 dir = "funga_records"
)
```

#### *5. `funga_search` and `funga_match`: Resolve your own species names*

Unlike `funga_records()`, which browses the checklist itself,
`funga_search()` and `funga_match()` take a list of names *you already
have* (e.g. from your own fungarium or field data) and resolve them
against the FFB checklist — with exact matching first, then fuzzy
(Levenshtein-distance) matching as a fallback for typos.

``` r
library(fungaR)

# Resolve a single name (synonyms are resolved to their accepted name)
funga_search("Phellinus piptadeniae")

# Resolve a list, flagging exact vs. fuzzy matches
splist <- c("Trichoderma harzianum", "Phellinus piptadeniae", "Cookeina tricholoma")
funga_search(splist, show_correct = TRUE, progress_bar = TRUE)

# Compare two independent name lists, aligning names that resolve to the
# same accepted taxon (e.g. checking your list against a collaborator's)
splist1 <- c("Trichoderma harzianum", "Xylaria polymorpha", "Cookeina tricholoma")
splist2 <- c("Hypocrea lixii", "Xylaria polymorpha", "Cookeina sulcipes")
funga_match(splist1, splist2, include_all = TRUE)
```

#### *6. `funga_get_children_taxa`: Explore the taxonomic hierarchy*

Retrieve all child taxa (species, subspecies, varieties, genera, etc.)
below a given taxonomic name and rank — useful for getting every species
in a genus, every genus in an order, and so on. Fungi are classified in
FFB by Division (phylum-equivalent, e.g. Ascomycota, Basidiomycota)
rather than Class, and FFB does not register a standalone family-rank
record for Fungi — `rank = "family"` is still supported, matched
directly against genus/species records’ classification column instead.

``` r
library(fungaR)

# All species in a genus
funga_get_children_taxa(taxon_name = "Trichoderma",
                        rank = "genus",
                        child_rank = "species")

# All genera in a family, including synonyms
funga_get_children_taxa(taxon_name = "Fomitopsidaceae",
                        rank = "family",
                        child_rank = "genus",
                        include_synonyms = TRUE)

# All genera in an order
funga_get_children_taxa(taxon_name = "Agaricales",
                        rank = "order",
                        child_rank = "genus")
```

## Data Curation Workflow

`fungaR` also supports taxonomic experts in curating and expanding Flora
e Funga do Brasil’s fungal coverage, by cross-checking global
mycological and biodiversity repositories. Both `funga_mycobank_gap()`
and `funga_distribution_gap()` write their results in three
complementary forms: the returned `data.frame`, a downloadable `.xlsx`
spreadsheet, and — by default (`html_report = TRUE`) — a self-contained
**HTML report** with KPI counts, breakdown tables, and the full
candidate/record table as a sortable, filterable
[`DT`](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) widget with one-click
**copy/CSV/Excel download** buttons, opened automatically in your
browser in interactive sessions.

#### *7. `funga_mycobank_gap`: Find species missing from FFB*

Given a genus or order, cross-checks
[MycoBank](https://www.mycobank.org)’s global name database against the
current FFB checklist, flagging species-level names that exist in
MycoBank but are not yet registered in FFB. Optionally visits each
candidate’s own MycoBank name page (via
[`chromote`](https://rstudio.github.io/chromote/)) to read the type
specimen’s reported locality, flagging candidates that MycoBank itself
already associates with Brazil — no need to cross-check GBIF/speciesLink
for this. Returns a structured spreadsheet and HTML report — including
each name’s original MycoBank URL — ready for a taxonomist’s manual
review.

``` r
library(fungaR)

# MycoBank species in genus Trichoderma missing from FFB, flagging
# candidates MycoBank itself already associates with a Brazilian locality
gap <- funga_mycobank_gap(taxon = "Trichoderma", rank = "genus")

# Faster, without the per-candidate locality check
gap_fast <- funga_mycobank_gap(taxon = "Trichoderma", rank = "genus",
                               check_locality = FALSE)
```

#### *8. `funga_distribution_gap`: Find candidate new state records*

Given a fungal genus or species, checks GBIF, speciesLink, and the
Reflora Virtual Herbarium (via the
[`refloraR`](https://github.com/DBOSlab/refloraR) package) for specimen
evidence in Brazilian states that are not currently listed in FFB’s
official distribution for that taxon — flagging candidate new state
records. Its HTML report goes one step further than the state-level
table, listing the actual **individual occurrence records** behind each
new-state candidate, each linking directly to that record’s page on GBIF
or REFLORA.

``` r
library(fungaR)

gap <- funga_distribution_gap(taxon = "Phellinotus piptadeniae")

# Restrict the check to two states, using only GBIF
gap_ba_pe <- funga_distribution_gap(taxon = "Phellinotus piptadeniae",
                                    state = c("Minas Gerais", "Pernambuco"),
                                    sources = "gbif")
```
